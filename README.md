### Pick Your Workflow Mode
Plan and Act Modes are key to agentic workflow, helping you balance strategic thinking with hands-on development.

Plan mode provides a conversational, code-safe space where you can explore requirements, evaluate architecture options, and define a detailed implementation plan, while Act mode gives Agentforce full access to write code, deploy metadata, run tests, and it can also follow a plan if one was created. For this badge, we will start with the Act Mode.

1. At the bottom of the Agentforce Vibes window, ensure the Plan/Act toggle is set to Act.
2. In the Auto-approve section of the window, ensure the Edit checkbox is unchecked. Note: you can drag the divider to the right to expand the window.

Note
The Salesforce DX MCP server is enabled by default in the web-based IDE included in this playground, but for local VS Code users, MCP servers must be installed and enabled manually. To learn more about how to configure your MCP Server, see our documentation.

### Test Basic Functionality
Try these prompts to verify your setup.

Note: If the extension requests access to run commands, click the button to Approve.

1. Use the type your task here… input area to interact with Agentforce.
2. Enter this prompt: List all Lightning Web Components in my local project and in this repository.Copy
3. Press Enter.
You should see a message about your project not having any Lightning Web Components (LWC). Never fear, your quest does not end here. Onward to the next unit to fix the LWC issue.
